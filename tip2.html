                <p>Maintaining your car can seem like a daunting task, but with regular checkups and a solid checklist, you can keep your car running smoothly and extend its lifespan. Follow this comprehensive car maintenance guide to ensure you're on the right track.</p>

                <h2>1. Tire Care</h2>
                <p>Regularly check tire pressure and tread depth. A good rule of thumb is to check tire pressure monthly and rotate tires every 6,000 miles to ensure even wear.</p>

                <h2>2. Engine Oil & Filter</h2>
                <p>Engine oil is essential for keeping your engine running smoothly. Change the oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles or according to your vehicle's manual. Don't forget to replace the oil filter at the same time.</p>

                <h2>3. Brake Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Your brakes are vital to your safety. Regularly inspect your brake pads and discs, and if you notice any squealing or reduced braking efficiency, it’s time to replace them.</p>

                <h2>4. Battery Checks</h2>
                <p>Test your car's battery annually. Clean any corrosion around the terminals and ensure the battery is securely mounted. If it's more than 3 years old, consider replacing it before it fails unexpectedly.</p>

                <h2>5. Air Filters</h2>
                <p>Dirty air filters can reduce engine performance and fuel efficiency. Replace air filters every 12,000 to 15,000 miles or more often if you drive in dusty conditions.</p>

                <h2>6. Windshield Wipers & Fluids</h2>
                <p>Ensure your wipers are in good condition and replace them if they leave streaks or make noise. Keep windshield washer fluid topped up for safe driving, especially in winter.</p>

                <h2>7. Lights & Indicators</h2>
                <p>Check all your vehicle's lights, including headlights, taillights, and turn signals. Replace any bulbs that have burned out to ensure you’re visible to other drivers.</p>

                <h2>8. Timing Belt</h2>
                <p>The timing belt keeps your engine in sync. It should be replaced every 60,000 to 100,000 miles, depending on the make and model of your car.</p>

                <h2>9. Suspension System</h2>
                <p>Inspect your suspension for any signs of wear, such as bouncy rides or unusual noises. Worn suspension components can affect handling and safety.</p>

                <h2>10. Coolant & Radiator</h2>
                <p>Keep an eye on your car’s coolant level and replace it every 2 years or as recommended in your owner's manual. A well-maintained radiator is crucial for preventing overheating.</p>

                <p>By following this checklist, you’ll ensure that your car runs smoothly and remains in top condition for years to come. Regular maintenance helps prevent costly repairs down the road and keeps you safe on the road.</p>
