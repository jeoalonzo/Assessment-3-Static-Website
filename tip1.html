                <p>Whether your car is new or used, regular maintenance is key to keeping it safe and reliable for the long haul. Modern cars require attention to ensure they continue to run smoothly, with parts wearing out and oil needing changes over time.</p>
                <p>Here's a quick guide to basic car maintenance, from tire checks to oil changes, that will help you avoid costly repairs and ensure your car stays in top shape.</p>

                <h2>Maintaining Your Tires</h2>
                <p>Your tires are crucial for safety. They should be checked regularly for wear, bulges, or damage. Use a penny to check the tread: if Lincoln’s head is covered, your tires are still good. Tires typically last 3-6 years or up to 80,000 miles, but be sure to rotate them regularly as per your vehicle's manual.</p>

                <h2>Check Your Engine Oil</h2>
                <p>Engine oil keeps your car’s engine running smoothly. Check it regularly and top it up when necessary. Follow your car’s manual for how often to change it, usually every 3,000 to 5,000 miles.</p>

                <h2>Other Key Maintenance Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspect your headlights, taillights, and license plate lights to ensure they're working.</li>
                    <li>Replace your windshield wipers if they're leaving streaks or not clearing the windshield effectively.</li>
                    <li>Check and replace air filters for better engine performance.</li>
                    <li>Test your car's battery regularly to avoid unexpected failures.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By staying on top of these basic tasks, you can help keep your car in excellent condition and avoid expensive repairs down the road.</p>
